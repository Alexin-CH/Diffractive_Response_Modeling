# v4: Hybrid model for correction of order effects in 1D TiN sine structure

## Description
Here the goal is to correct for order effects in the simulation of a 1D TiN sine structure using a hybrid neural network model

## Dataset
The high order (20) dataset is generated using TORCWA, it contains 2400+ samples:
Range of parameters:
- Wavelength: 200 - 2500 nm
- Amplitude: 20 - 100 nm
- Period: 100 - 10000 nm
- Angle of incidence: 10 - 70 degrees
